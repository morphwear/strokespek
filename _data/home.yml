  heading: Insights for the next generation

  body: "My name is Konrad Antoniuk. I have competed at Olympic Trials and currently building a business and product that I believe would have helped me reach my full potnetial in my early years of training.
  Morphwear's mission is to enable the next generational leap in athletic performance with smarter training. Our products focus on providing athletes a measured approach toward achieving their goals.
  Beginning with competitive swimming, we are debuting our motion analysis algorithms in a sport where mechanical efficiency is critical and objective feedback is hard to come by. I understand the the commitment and skill required to compete at a high level.
  To ensure and prove the data's efficacy I am using the technology firsthand to assist myself in qualifying for the Olympic Trials. In addition, I have experinced siginificant success in using the technology on others, I feel it's time to make it available for others on their journey."
